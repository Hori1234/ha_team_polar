# HA team polar

Private repository for the activities of team polar, in the context of the honors academy

# GitLab guidelines
- Create a seperate branch for every new feature
- When finished with the feature merge the development branch into your branch and solve all merge conflicts in your branch. After this send a merge request


# GitLab and Catkin_ws integration (WIP)
To allow for an easy way to work the Team Polar GitLab should be cloned in the `catkin_ws/src/` to get the following structure that will be used for the catkin_ws.

```
catkin_ws/
├── src
│   ├── team_polar
│   │   ├── package1
│   │   ├── package2
│   │   ├── package3
```
